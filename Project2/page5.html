      <h4> Fun Fact: I took this photo during vacation last year! </h4>
      <p> You have reached the end of your vacation. You choose to spend your last few days at the Amalfi Coast. You explore Sorrento, Capri, and other areas in the coast. The views are breathtaking. You feel a cool breeze, then suddenly feel warmth from the sun. Unfortunately, you will be starting work and can only take holidays off for the first few months. At least you can always travel to another country during the weekends?  </p>
