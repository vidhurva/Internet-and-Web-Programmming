    <h1> Current Location: Kyoto </h1>
    <p> You spend your last few days at Kyoto, Japan. You cross a bridge on top of a large pond. You look down below and admire your own reflection but also admire how the water reflects everything within your vision. There are plenty of beautiful gardens in the area. Unfortunately, you will be starting work and can only take holidays off for the first few months. At least you can always travel to another country during weekends? </p>
